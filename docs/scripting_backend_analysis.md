# Scripting Backend Analysis for Wisp Engine

## Performance Comparison

### Lua (Current)
- **Pros**: Easy integration, familiar syntax, good for prototyping
- **Cons**: Interpreted, GC pauses, memory overhead, ~10-50x slower than native
- **Memory**: ~50KB base + script overhead
- **Performance**: Acceptable for simple games, struggles with complex logic

### WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Pros**: Near-native performance, sandboxed, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Larger runtime, compilation complexity, limited ESP32 support
- **Memory**: ~100-200KB runtime + compiled modules
- **Performance**: 80-95% of native speed
- **Status**: Experimental on ESP32, promising for future

### Rust (Compiled)
- **Pros**: Zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, native performance
- **Cons**: Compilation complexity, larger binaries, learning curve
- **Memory**: Compiled code only, very efficient
- **Performance**: 100% native speed
- **Status**: Excellent fit for embedded systems

### Native C++ (Direct)
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, full hardware access, smallest footprint
- **Cons**: No sandboxing, requires recompilation, safety concerns
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead
- **Performance**: 100% native speed

## Recommended Architecture: Modular Scripting Interface

Support multiple backends through a unified API, allowing migration path:
1. **Phase 1**: Ultra-lite Lua for rapid development
2. **Phase 2**: Add WASM support for performance-critical apps
3. **Phase 3**: Add Rust compilation pipeline
4. **Phase 4**: Native C++ for maximum performance

## Implementation Strategy

Create a scripting abstraction layer that can support any backend, starting with optimized Lua and evolving to WASM/Rust as the platform matures.
