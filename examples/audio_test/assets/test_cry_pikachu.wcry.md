# test_cry_pikachu.wcry - Pikachu Cry Sound

## Purpose
Synthesized creature cry for testing cry generation and playback systems.

## Specifications
- **Format**: Wisp Cry (.wcry)
- **Duration**: 1.0-1.5 seconds
- **Sample Rate**: 22050 Hz
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Generation**: Procedural cry synthesis
- **Type**: Character/creature vocalization

## Cry Characteristics
Pikachu-inspired synthesized vocalization:
- **Base Frequency**: 300-500 Hz (higher pitched, cute)
- **Modulation**: Rapid frequency sweeps and vibrato
- **Pattern**: "Pika-pika" rhythm with two distinct syllables
- **Timbre**: Bright, electronic, slightly buzzy
- **Expression**: Energetic and friendly

## Synthesis Parameters
Parameters for cry generation:
- **Syllable Count**: 2 ("Pi-ka")
- **Frequency Range**: 300-800 Hz with sweeps
- **Modulation Rate**: 15-20 Hz vibrato
- **Attack Time**: Very fast (10ms)
- **Decay Pattern**: Gradual with slight upturn
- **Noise Component**: Minimal, clean tone

## Technical Requirements
- Procedural generation from parameters
- Consistent output between generations
- Clear syllable separation
- Pleasant, non-grating tone quality
- Suitable for repeated playback

## Usage in Test
- Cry synthesis engine validation
- Parameter-based audio generation
- Character sound consistency
- Procedural audio quality testing
- Real-time synthesis performance

## Expected Content
A bright, energetic creature vocalization that captures the essence of Pikachu's famous cry through synthesized audio. Should demonstrate the engine's ability to generate recognizable character sounds procedurally.
