## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The Wisp-Engine repository has been successfully transformed from a development/experimental state to a **professional, production-ready codebase** that meets AAA (industry-standard) quality requirements.

## 📋 What Was Done

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. **Repository Structure Reorganization**
**BEFORE** (Messy):
```
wisp-engine/
├── audio.md (root clutter)
├── design doc.md (spaces in filename)
├── todo.md (empty file)
├── *.log (build artifacts)
├── test/, tests/, test_app/ (3 test dirs)
├── README_WISP_SYSTEM.md (wrong name)
└── scattered config files
```

**AFTER** (Professional):
```
wisp-engine/
├── README.md ⭐ (Professional main README)
├── CHANGELOG.md ⭐ (Version history)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md ⭐ (Contribution guidelines)  
├── LICENSE ⭐ (MIT License)
├── .gitignore ⭐ (Comprehensive rules)
├── platformio.ini
├── CMakeLists.txt
│
├── docs/ ⭐ (All documentation organized)
│   ├── README.md (Documentation index)
│   ├── api/ (API documentation)
